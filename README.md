# Politics
A computer system (probably decentralized) in which we propose and vote what we want.

I wanna make politics easier and faster, and most importantly, guarantee that democracy works, with transparency and the true ability to vote what we want for ourselves. The system would contain the 'Constitution' of our country, and probably would explain which laws are aplicable for each person if that person has a profile with it's characteristics.

The most important part would be the voting system. Everyone should be able to make a proposal at anytime, and should be able to see and filter the proposals of other people. That would behave like a social network (like, vote, share...), but with a more advanced voting/liking system. To really vote a proposal you should understand and accept the consequences like a contract. If you want to build something, you will have to pay for it. (Responsibility to take action if your proposal is successful, pay more taxes for some service...). Also, if you want to make a proposal upon other proposal or change the details, people should be able to easily vote you, and choose how to change the main proposal based on your modifications (like an open source community working with github). Depending on the conditions, you could vote proposals near you (your city etc), and bigger general changes of the entire country. Possibly have more inluence near you with local changes, depending on who pays and who benefits... (Deliberative democracy). The voting system of the Compound protocol could serve as reference.

This system would guarantee transparency, and would make corruption impossible. Everyone should be able to see how money flows between public institutions, and the program would make the money flow based on the results of the proposals, instead of by the decision of someone. I think that we could make changes to the software itself through the main system of proposals, recursively, to add more functionalities.

If a task is too specific, we could choose someone to make the decisions and plan everything to work, and then, choose if we like the results. Obviously we don't have to vote everything, and the details to make a political system stable, preventing fast random changes of opinion, have to be worked.

The person/organization that has proposed some change could itself be willing to lead the details of the project, documenting all the info that they previously agreed, and the info that people asks for as the project develops.
